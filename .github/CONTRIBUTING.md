Contributor Agreement
All contributors are required to sign the Delphix Contributor agreement prior to contributing code to an open source repository. This process is handled automatically by cla-assistant. Simply open a pull request and a bot will automatically check to see if you have signed the latest agreement. If not, you will be prompted to do so as part of the pull request process.

Code of Conduct
This project operates under the Delphix Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Our Review Process

When you submit a pull request, our team follows this internal process:

1.  **Fork and Test**: We fork your branch to run it through our internal, comprehensive testing suite.
2.  **JIRA Ticket Creation**: A JIRA ticket is created to track the contribution through our internal workflows.
3.  **Merge to Main**: Once your changes pass all tests and reviews, they are merged into the `main` branch by a Delphix team member.
4.  **PR Closure**: After a successful merge, we will close your original pull request.

We appreciate your contribution and patience during this process!
