# PERFORCE® DELPHIX CONTRIBUTOR CODE OF CONDUCT

**Last Revised:** December 12, 2025
**Effective Date:** December 15, 2025

## Purpose

Delphix Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Delphix,” “we,” or “our”), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perforce Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Perforce”), is committed to fostering an open source environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Perforce Delphix code of conduct (the “Code of Conduct”).

## Scope

This Code of Conduct outlines Delphix’s expectations of each of the members of the Delphix open source community (the “Community”), both online and offline. A member of the Community’s participation in the Delphix open source activities is contingent upon following this Code of Conduct, which includes, but is not limited to: 
1.	Contributing to the Delphix open source projects located in the Delphix GitHub Organization, and the Delphix Open Source site; or
2.	When an individual is officially representing the Community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing the Community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, Delphix strives to meet the members of the Community’s expectations for positive behavior. Delphix understands that each person’s words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, Delphix desires that each member of the Community behaves mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center the Community’s shared values, including:
1.	Respecting the purpose of the Community, our activities, and the Community’s ways of gathering.
2.	Engaging kindly and honestly with others.
3.	Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
4.	Taking responsibility for one’s own actions and contributions.
5.	Gracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback and keeping unstructured critiques to a minimum.
6.	Committing to repairing harm when it occurs.
7.	Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the well-being of the Community.

## Restricted Behaviors

Delphix expects everyone interacting in the Community to restrict the following behaviors in the Community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct and will not be tolerated.
1.	Harassment. Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
2.	Character Attacks. Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3.	Stereotyping or Discrimination. Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4.	Sexualization. Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the Delphix open source community.
5.	Violating Confidentiality. Sharing or acting on someone’s personal or private information without their permission.
6.	Endangerment. Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
7.	Threatening Actions. Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of the Community, which includes, without limitation, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior.
8.	Misleading Identity. Impersonating someone else for any reason or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
9.	Failing to Credit Sources. Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute to the Delphix open source projects or to other members of the Community’s projects.
10.	Promotional Materials. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the Community, or as expressly prohibited by Delphix.
11.	Irresponsible Communication. Failing to responsibly present content which includes links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between Community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a violation of this Code of Conduct, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, please contact the Delphix team at: open-source@delphix.com.

Community moderators take reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. The Community moderators will investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. The Community moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the Community moderators finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident’s impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

1.	**Warning**
    1.	Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
    2.	Consequence: A private, written warning from the Community moderators.
    3.	Repair: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.
2.	**Temporarily Limited Activities**
    1.	Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
    2.	Consequence: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the Community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular Community members.
    3.	Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering the Community spaces after the period is over.
3.	**Temporary Suspension**
    1.	Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
    2.	Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.
    3.	Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.
4.	**Permanent Ban**
    1.	Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community moderators determine there is no way to keep the Community safe with this person as a member.
    2.	Consequence: Access to all Community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, permanent bans should be rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior.
    3.	Repair: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the ability of Community managers to use their discretion and judgment in keeping with the best interests of the Community.
