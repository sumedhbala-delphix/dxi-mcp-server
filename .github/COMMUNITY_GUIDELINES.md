# PERFORCE® DELPHIX OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

**Last Revised:** December 15, 2025
**Effective Date:** December 15, 2025

This document provides the guidelines (these “Guidelines”) that are established by Delphix Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Delphix”), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Perforce Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Perforce”), to cover the interaction between Delphix and the communities that are formed around the open source contributions from Delphix (the “Delphix Open Source Community”), when such parties are making use of a Perforce® Delphix open source software project (the “Delphix Open Source Project(s)”).

## PURPOSE

The intent of these Guidelines is to provide guidance to the Perforce Delphix Open Source Community who use the Delphix Open Source Projects around the proper use, attribution, presentation, and contribution to the improvement of the Delphix Open Source Projects. These Guidelines are an essential part of supporting and extending the Perforce Delphix software platform through open source software projects. Delphix regularly creates new software platform integrations and tools that extend the Delphix software platform, and Delphix makes these integrations and tools available for use with open source licensing. Delphix wants to ensure that all of the Delphix software platform’s users, including the Delphix Open Source Community, can discover, use, support, and evolve those integrations.

While contributions to the Delphix Open Source Projects from Delphix partners and other third parties are welcome and encouraged, such Delphix partners and other third parties must follow the same contribution process and requirements outlined in these Guidelines that are asked of the Delphix Open Source Community. These Guidelines do not cover commercial arrangements with Delphix professional services or partners, nor do they cover other aspects of the broader Delphix community, such as user groups or partner programs.

## Community Conduct

All members of the Delphix Open Source Community and all Delphix employees must abide by the Delphix Code of Conduct. Each Delphix Open Source Project repository has one or more Delphix employees listed as the project’s maintainers. These maintainers are accountable for the success of the specific Delphix Open Source Projects repository and for the engagement of the members of the Delphix Open Source Community that are contributing to the repository. This includes enforcing the Delphix Code of Conduct, responding to issues, supporting external Delphix Open Source Community leaders, and managing contributions. Some members of the Delphix Open Source Community may be added as additional project maintainers at the discretion of existing Delphix employee maintainers. In the event that concerns cannot be resolved through the Delphix employee representatives, please email delphix.opensource@perforce.com to contact the Delphix Open Source Community leadership team.

## Availability of Source and Artifacts

All source code for a Delphix Open Source Project will be made available through GitHub repositories and be freely accessible to all. These repositories are created within the Delphix GitHub Organization, and are also visible on the Delphix Open Source site. Every Delphix Open Source Project is licensed under an OSI-approved license, with Apache 2.0 being the preferred standard.

All releases are tagged using GitHub releases. Release artifacts, if present, should be made available through GitHub releases. Artifacts may also be made available through other means, such as package managers specific to third party tools.

## Documentation

All Delphix Open Source Projects, and all contributions to Delphix Open Source Projects, must include a README.md file that describes the purpose of the project, how to get the software, and how to use it. The README.md file must include links to these Guidelines as well as the Delphix Code of Conduct.

In the event that additional documentation is necessary, projects may use the repository’s wiki or hosted documentation such as readthedocs. Any such documentation must be linked from the README.md file.

## Support

All contributions and pull requests for Delphix Open Source Projects must include the Delphix Statement of Support in the README.md file and wherever the software may be acquired.

Delphix customers with a standard support agreement have access to Delphix support team members who can help troubleshoot to ensure that all licensed components of the platform are working as designed. If the community extension is the source of the issue, customers will be directed to the appropriate Delphix Open Source Community channel for support. If assistance is required to modify or alter the extension, customers can engage with Delphix Open Source Community partners, contact Delphix services for additional help, or make open source contributions themselves.

If you find a known issue with a Delphix Open Source Project, please submit a GitHub issue for the appropriate repository. Maintainers will acknowledge new issues within five (5) business days. While there is no guaranteed resolution time and no commitment to fix all issues, maintainers will respond with an assessment of the issue and potential timeline when feasible. You can also use GitHub issues to submit feature requests.

If you have general questions that are not known to be a defect or a feature request, please ask the members of the Delphix Open Source Community through the Perforce Delphix Community Forums.

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

Delphix takes security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciates the security research community’s efforts in responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability in any Delphix Open Source Projects, please report it privately to security@perforce.com rather than through public GitHub issues or forums. This allows us to assess and address the vulnerability before it becomes public knowledge. When reporting security vulnerabilities, please provide reasonable time for Delphix to investigate and address the issue before making any public disclosure. We will acknowledge receipt of security vulnerability reports within two (2) business days. While security fixes will be prioritized above other development work, Delphix does not guarantee specific resolution timeframes as the complexity of security issues varies significantly. Delphix requests that security researchers follow responsible disclosure practices, including refraining from accessing or modifying data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability, and avoiding any actions that could harm Delphix users or degrade Delphix’s offerings. Delphix thanks the security community for their valuable contributions in helping keep Delphix projects and our Community Members and other Delphix software platform users secure.

## Certification and Testing

Delphix does not proactively test or certify open source extensions with each new product release. These projects are provided “as-is” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. Delphix recommends that you perform your own testing prior to using community projects in production or mission critical scenarios. Each project should have its own development and testing strategy to ensure high quality across updates. This should include leveraging stable APIs to ensure compatibility with new product releases.

## Contributing

All contributions must be made as pull requests to the appropriate repository. Contributions should include appropriate tests, documentation updates for new features, and must follow the project’s coding standards. All discussions around the pull requests should happen on GitHub, though offline conversations may be required when more extensive discussions are required. Maintainers will accept pull requests after they have been reviewed, approved, and all contribution requirements are met. Every effort will be made to respond and iterate in a timely fashion, though no specific guarantees are made.

All external contributors must sign the Delphix Contributor Agreement (the “CLA”) prior to submitting any pull request. No pull requests will be reviewed or merged without a signed CLA on file. This requirement applies to all contributions, regardless of whether the contributor is an individual or a legal entity, the size of the contribution, or the significance of the contribution.
