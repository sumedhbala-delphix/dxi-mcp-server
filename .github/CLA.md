# PERFORCE® DELPHIX INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions from any person or entity, Delphix Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Delphix”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Perforce Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Perforce”), must have a Contributor License Agreement (the “CLA”) agreed to by each party who desires to contribute source code, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This CLA is for the contributor’s protection as well as the protection of Delphix and its users, and this CLA does not change the contributor’s rights to use the contributor’s own Contributions (as such term is defined in Section 1 below) for any other purpose. Please read this CLA carefully before agreeing to it and keep a copy for your records.

By acknowledging your acceptance and agreement to the following terms and conditions in this CLA, this will govern all of Your (as such term is defined in Section 1 below) present and future Contributions submitted to Delphix. Except for the license granted herein to Delphix and recipients of software distributed by Delphix, You reserve all other right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

**1. Definitions.** 

1.1. “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this CLA with Delphix. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

1.2. “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Delphix for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Delphix (the “Work”). For the purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Delphix or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Delphix for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”

**2. Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Delphix and to recipients of software distributed by Delphix a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**3. Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Delphix and to recipients of software distributed by Delphix a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**4. Representations.** 

4.1. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Delphix, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Delphix.

4.2. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see Section 6 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

4.3. You agree to notify Delphix of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make the provisions set forth in this CLA inaccurate in any respect.

**5. Support for Contributions.** You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**6. Submissions on Behalf of Others.** Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Delphix separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]”.

**7. Privacy.** This CLA is a legal agreement containing personally identifiable information. Please refer to Perforce and Delphix’s Privacy Policy that governs how Delphix may use and share this information. 

**8. Miscellaneous.** This CLA and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA without regard to application of conflicts of law rules or principles. Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this CLA will be a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, USA, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any such actions. This CLA is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement, and any amendments thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. The parties may transmit their signatures via scanned PDF, e-signature, or other electronic signature tools with the same effect as if the parties had provided each other with original signatures.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have executed this Agreement to be effective as of the last date entered underneath the parties’ signatures.
