# PERFORCE® DELPHIX CORPORATE CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT

Delphix Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Delphix”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Perforce Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Perforce”), appreciates community contributions to code repositories open sourced by Delphix. To ensure that the community is free to use the contributions from the corporate contributor noted in the signature block below (the “Corporate Contributor”), Delphix must have a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (the “Agreement”) on file that has been signed by the Corporate Contributor, indicating the Corporate Contributor’s agreement to the license terms below. The Agreement is for the protection of Delphix, the Corporate Contributor, and the third parties who are accessing the code. Please note that signing this Agreement does not change the Corporate Contributor’s rights to use its own contributions for any other purpose.

The Corporate Contributor acknowledges, accepts, and agrees to the following terms and conditions for present and future Contributions (as such term is defined below in Section 1) submitted by the Corporate Contributor to Delphix. In return, Delphix acknowledges and agrees not to use the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions in a way that is contrary to the public benefit. Except for the license granted herein to Delphix and recipients of the software distributed by Delphix, the Corporate Contributor reserves all right, title, and interest in and to the Contributions.

**1. Definitions.**

1.1. “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by the Corporate Contributor to Delphix for inclusion in, or documentation of, any Projects. For the purposes of this definition, and as used in this Agreement, “submitted” or “submission” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Delphix or its representatives, including, but not limited to, communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Delphix for the purpose of discussing and improving the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Corporate Contributor as “Not a Contribution.”

1.2. “Project” means any of the projects owned or managed by Delphix in which software, and any related documentation, are offered under a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (the “OSI”) (www.opensource.org).

**2. Licenses.**

2.1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporate Contributor hereby grants to Delphix, and to recipients of software distributed by Delphix, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions and such derivative works for the Project.

2.2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Corporate Contributor hereby grants to Delphix, and to recipients of software distributed by Delphix, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this Section 2) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions in the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by the Corporate Contributor that are necessarily infringed by the Corporate Contributor’s Contribution(s) alone or by combination of the Corporate Contributor’s Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against the Corporate Contributor or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Project to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.

**3. Representations and Warranties.** The Corporate Contributor represents and warrants that: (a) the Corporate Contributor is legally entitled to grant the licenses in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this Agreement; (b) each of the Corporate Contributor’s submissions is entirely the Corporate Contributor’s original work (except as the Corporate Contributor may have disclosed under Section 5 below); (c) the Corporate Contributor’s Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which the Corporate Contributor is personally aware and that are associated with any part of the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions; (d) the Corporate Contributor has all intellectual property rights in the Corporate Contributor’s submission by contract or applicable law; (e) the person signing this Agreement on behalf of the Corporate Contributor has the necessary authority to bind the Corporate Contributor to the obligations contained in this Agreement; and (f) the Corporate Contributor agrees to notify Delphix of any facts or circumstances that the Corporate Contributor becomes aware of that would make the representations and warranties provided in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect. UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 2, 3, AND 5, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**4. Information.** The Corporate Contributor agrees that the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions to Projects and information about the Corporate Contributor’s Contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including the Corporate Contributor’s name and other information that the Corporate Contributor submits to the Project.

**5. Submission of Other’s Original Creations.** Should the Corporate Contributor wish to submit work that is not the Corporate Contributor’s original creation, the Corporate Contributor may submit it to Delphix separately from any Contribution, by identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which the Corporate Contributor is personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as, “Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here].”

**6. Miscellaneous.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of, connected with, or relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court located in State of Delaware, USA. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Delphix. This Agreement, and any amendments thereto, may be executed in one or more counterparts each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. The parties may transmit their signatures via scanned PDF, e-signature, or other electronic signature tools with the same effect as if the parties had provided each other with original signatures.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have executed this Agreement to be effective as of the last date entered underneath the parties’ signatures.
