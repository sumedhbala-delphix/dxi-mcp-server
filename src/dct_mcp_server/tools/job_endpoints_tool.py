This is only set when when the JOB is in STARTED status, with the guarantee that the job will not transition to the FAILED status. Note that this flag will likely be replaced with a new status in future API versions and be deprecated.

     - engine_ids: IDs of the engines this Job is executing on.
     - tags: No description
     - engines: No description
     - account_id: The ID of the account who initiated this job.
     - account_name: The account name which initiated this job. It can be either firstname and lastname combination or firstname or lastname or username or email address or Account-<id>.
     - percent_complete: Completion percentage of the Job.
     - virtualization_tasks: No description
     - tasks: No description
     - execution_id: The ID of the associated masking execution, if any.
     - result_type: The type of the job result. This is the type of the object present in the result.
     - result: The result of the job execution. This is JSON serialized string of the result object whose type is specified by result_type property.

    How to use filter_expresssion: 
    A request body containing a filter expression. This enables searching
    for items matching arbitrarily complex conditions. The list of
    attributes which can be used in filter expressions is available
    in the x-filterable vendor extension.
    
    # Filter Expression Overview
    **Note: All keywords are case-insensitive**
    
    ## Comparison Operators
    | Operator | Description | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | CONTAINS | Substring or membership testing for string and list attributes respectively. | field3 CONTAINS 'foobar', field4 CONTAINS TRUE  |
    | IN | Tests if field is a member of a list literal. List can contain a maximum of 100 values | field2 IN ['Goku', 'Vegeta'] |
    | GE | Tests if a field is greater than or equal to a literal value | field1 GE 1.2e-2 |
    | GT | Tests if a field is greater than a literal value | field1 GT 1.2e-2 |
    | LE | Tests if a field is less than or equal to a literal value | field1 LE 9000 |
    | LT | Tests if a field is less than a literal value | field1 LT 9.02 |
    | NE | Tests if a field is not equal to a literal value | field1 NE 42 |
    | EQ | Tests if a field is equal to a literal value | field1 EQ 42 |
    
    ## Search Operator
    The SEARCH operator filters for items which have any filterable
    attribute that contains the input string as a substring, comparison
    is done case-insensitively. This is not restricted to attributes with
    string values. Specifically `SEARCH '12'` would match an item with an
    attribute with an integer value of `123`.
    
    ## Logical Operators
    Ordered by precedence.
    | Operator | Description | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | NOT | Logical NOT (Right associative) | NOT field1 LE 9000 |
    | AND | Logical AND (Left Associative) | field1 GT 9000 AND field2 EQ 'Goku' |
    | OR | Logical OR (Left Associative) | field1 GT 9000 OR field2 EQ 'Goku' |
    
    ## Grouping
    Parenthesis `()` can be used to override operator precedence.
    
    For example:
    NOT (field1 LT 1234 AND field2 CONTAINS 'foo')
    
    ## Literal Values
    | Literal      | Description | Examples |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Nil | Represents the absence of a value | nil, Nil, nIl, NIL |
    | Boolean | true/false boolean | true, false, True, False, TRUE, FALSE |
    | Number | Signed integer and floating point numbers. Also supports scientific notation. | 0, 1, -1, 1.2, 0.35, 1.2e-2, -1.2e+2 |
    | String | Single or double quoted | "foo", "bar", "foo bar", 'foo', 'bar', 'foo bar' |
    | Datetime | Formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) | 2018-04-27T18:39:26.397237+00:00 |
    | List | Comma-separated literals wrapped in square brackets | [0], [0, 1], ['foo', "bar"] |
    
    ## Limitations
    - A maximum of 8 unique identifiers may be used inside a filter expression.
